\chapter{PolySQL Syntax - Freshness Extension}
\todo{Maybe also add MQL}
This chapter provides an in-depth extension to the existing PolySQL Syntax for freshness related queries.
The original PolySQL Syntax will not be illustrated in this chapter.

All valid extensions for Freshness must consequently begin with the keywords \emph{WITH FRESHNESS}.
They are attached as an optional leaf expression for every \emph{SELECT} statement.
