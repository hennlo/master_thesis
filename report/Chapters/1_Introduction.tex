\chapter{Introduction}
\label{c:intro}

For the past decade, cloud computing has become a crucial and central part in the industry \cite{claremont:2005}.
This technological advancement in infrastructure provisioning allows companies to obtain 
software as well as hardware resources to compose their entire data center virtually in the cloud.
Without having to invest in expensive hardware and real estate they can now avoid maintaining 
their computing resources solely on premise. These providers usually manage different distributed data centers 
across the globe and provide private or shared access on resources according to their 
Service Level Agreement (SLA). Such guarantees in quality-of-service (QoS) usually 
include elastic up- and down-scaling of resources and a high degree of availability,
which is achieved by replicating data throughout different regions \cite{brinkmann:2015} \cite{terry:2013}. 

Ever since the rise of the \emph{Big Data} era, these providers are faced with continuous
and rapidly growing heterogeneous datasets. These are accompanied by widely varying requirements 
and characteristics for data driven applications. This increased the need to leverage custom-tailored 
database systems to gain meaningful insights on their data as quickly as possible.
To efficiently process and extract relevant information out of these data silos new systems
have emerged. These aim to provide a solution for the new demands on varying workloads 
and ever-growing data sources.
Such novel Polystore systems combine several distributed physical data engines to enable various
new possibilities and provide the best response time for every use case by exploiting
the key benefits of each engine \cite{stonebraker:2005} \cite{polypheny2020}. Although these data management systems are inherently
built to process heterogeneous data with high throughput, the amount of produced data
still grows continuously.
Therefore, the importance to efficiently access the right data is crucial
for organizations to stay economical and competitive. Cloud providers which offer such systems consequently 
need reliable functionality to manage these large volumes of data. Otherwise, they would waste useful 
computations and time when users try to retrieve relevant data items ~\cite{levandowski2013}.
To comply with their QoS requirements and sufficiently provide acceptable access times for their services, 
they have come up with data freshness strategies as an essential part of data management in a
distributed setup. 
The freshness in such cases reflects how current and up-to-date a specific data item is.
Since not all applications pursue similar goals, they often require different levels of freshness.
These levels can be used to identify a well-suited location to retrieve the desired data object. 
This consequently mitigates the need to always update every existing data replica to the most recent state.
Changes can now rather be deferred, until they are processable by the underlying system again.
Such delayed updates now allow for a much higher throughput and increased performance in scenarios were also slightly 
outdated data is acceptable.

\section{Polystores}

The decision which data structure to use and built upon is a crucial step for the overall performance of a systems design, as suggested by
H.Plattner and B.Leukert ~\cite{plattner2015}.\\
While row-oriented data stores might be useful and preferred for write-heavy transactional 
workloads they are rather insufficient for purely analytical workload which would rather benefit from a
column-oriented data store with less write operations ~\cite{sigmond2008}.\\

Despite the fact that nowadays there exist a variety of Database Management Systems (DBMS) which were originally created with an intention to
support specific scenarios,
applications are getting more complex relying on various requirements and characteristics 
to serve multiple use cases at once.
That is why modern day applications can not solely rely on one storage technology alone. 
Consequently Multi- and Polystore systems have emerged. \\
\\
While multistore database systems aim to combine and manage data across heterogeneous data stores,
polystore systems are essentially based on the idea of combining multistores with
\textit{polyglot persistence} ~\cite{polypheny2020}.
Polyglot persistence is a term which refers to a practice originated from the concept 
of \textit{polyglot programming} or microservice architectures, to utilize different 
programming languages for different task requirements following a best-fit approach ~\cite{fowler2011}. \\
Along this paradigm, polystores want to utilize multiple data storage technologies to
fulfill different needs for different application components in order to cope
with mixed and varying workloads.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Goal?}
The system therefore needs to be able to allow transactional as well as analytical workload in parallel. 

\todoMissing{SHow in motiviational scenario, that priamry updates highly impact the performcne if only one or all are udpated or even the wrong store}

\todoMissing{Allow parallel workload (transactional analytical) by reducing locks and allowing reads to be applied to outdated nodes}

\section{Contribution}
The contribution of this thesis is fivefold. First, we identify and define necessary requirements to establish freshness-awareness in general.
Second, we outline and propose various possibilities to enable freshness-awareness. Forth, we introduce a query extension to allow the specification
of tolerated and desirable freshness levels on various metrics. Fifth, 

To identify necessary requirements to implemented and design possible 
freshness variations in a polystore system. Several aspects of previous published research work is compared and considered when adapting it to polystore systems.

\section{Outline}
This thesis is structured as follows:
Chapter \ref{c:motivation} motivates and illustrates the benefits of a freshness-aware data management approach and how it would impact a given scenario.
In Chapter \ref{c:related} the foundations and concepts of data freshness characteristics and requirements are presented.
We give an overview over the current state of research in the field of data freshness. 
Chapter \ref{c:Foundation} illustrates existing fundamental concepts in the context of distributed data management systems. 
Chapter \ref{c:concept} describes the functional requirements, necessary to introduce the notion of freshness inside a polystore system. Additionally, 
it proposes and discusses possible approaches how to implement them in a polystore system. 
In Chapter \ref{c:implementation} these concepts including all requirements and building blocks will be applied to Polypheny-DB, a specific polystore system.
While Chapter \ref{c:evaluation} focuses on possibilities how to ensure correctness and measure the performance of an implementation, including all necessary prerequisites.
Finally, Chapter \ref{c:conclusion} concludes the thesis by summarizing the individual contributions according to the proposed
implementations and gives an outlook to future work and possible extensions.
