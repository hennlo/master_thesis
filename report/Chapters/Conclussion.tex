\section{Outlook}

\subsection{Tuneable Consistency}
The introduced implementation sketched in section \ref{c:implementation} reduces the overall consistency of the primary transaction,
to improve the overall response time of the system.\\ 
But since this tradeoff between availability and consistency certainly depends on the use case orservice requirements, it would be beneficial.
Hence, an extension to the described model could easily allow to adjust the required consistency as needed. 
This could be either done by the mentioned usage of policies, described in section \ref{sec:polcies} or with..

\subsection{Locking}
Reduce locking to a physical partition level  (partition placement)

\tocless\section{Unified transaction model for semantically rich operations}
Intorduce semantically rich operations inside polypheny? 
Maybe not on the scope of an application level but to encompass the underlying transactions
