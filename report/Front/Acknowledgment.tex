First of all, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Heiko Schuldt for giving me the opportunity to
conduct my Master's Thesis in the Database and Information Systems (DBIS) group.\\

I also want to thank my supervisor Marco Vogt, for the helpful discussions and his valuable
feedback throughout this time. I could always rely on his advice and guidance,
providing me with insightful input whenever I had a question.\\

Additionally, I would like to thank Daniel Ha√ü and Lisa Gauthier for proofreading this thesis.
Their review and comments helped to form and shape this thesis.\\

Finally, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my family and friends, 
for providing me with unfailing support.
Their continuous encouragement allowed me to overcome every obstacle that I encountered
over the years.
This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.
